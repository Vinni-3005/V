                        <h4> Software Development</h4>
                        <p>
                            Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software.
                            Software itself is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of hardware and makes computers programmable. 
                            There are three basic types:
                            1.System software to provide core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management and other operational necessities.
                            2.Programming software to give programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers and other tools to create code.
                            3.Application software (applications or apps) to help users perform tasks. Office productivity suites, data management software, media players and 
                            security programs are examples. Applications also refers to web and mobile applications like those used to shop on Amazon.com, socialize with Facebook or post pictures to Instagram.

                        <h4> Mobile App Development</h4>
                        <p>
                            Mobile application development is the process of making software for smartphones, tablets and digital assistants, most commonly for the Android and iOS operating systems.
                             The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a mobile web browser. The programming and markup languages used for
                             this kind of software development include Java, Swift, C# and HTML5.

                        <h4> Application Development</h4>
                        <p>
                            Application development is the process of creating a computer program in a language like Java, SQL, Python, Go, Rust, etc. or a set of programs or services to perform 
                            the different tasks that an enterprise or an endeavor requires. This software can be as simple as a functional web site, mobile apps for purchasing, organizing, or scheduling,
                             or more complex software which can manage supply chains, healthcare delivery applications, or large construction projects.
